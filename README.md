# 📊 Public Distribution System (PDS) Efficiency Analysis – India 🇮🇳

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive data science case study** analyzing the **allocation and distribution efficiency** of wheat and rice under India's **Public Distribution System (PDS)**. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies, regional disparities, and predictive trends using statistical analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboards.

It was developed as part of the **Data Science Specialization** at **Symbiosis Institute of Technology**, under the guidance of [Dr. Piyush Chauhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyush-chauhan-b5aa1544/) and [Amit Makode Sir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmakode/), with special thanks to our Director [Prof. Dr. Nitin Rakesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-nitin-rakesh-67a4297a/) for including this course in the curriculum.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 📈 **Rice distribution** has strong alignment with allocations (R² = 0.85), while wheat shows inefficiencies (R² = 0.46).
- 🧪 **Statistical tests (t-test & ANOVA)** reveal significant differences in efficiency across states and commodities.
- 🔍 **Clustering (K-Means)** highlights underperforming districts and flags an outlier with extreme rice efficiency.
- 📆 **Monthly efficiency trends** indicate seasonal operational stress (e.g., during COVID lockdowns).
- 📊 **Power BI dashboard** allows real-time filtering by state, district, and time for actionable insights.
